        <em>
          Twenty years pass.<br />
          The numbers climb.<br />
          The stock price soars.<br /><br />
          Who decides who gets to fight?<br />
          Who decides who gets to die?<br /><br />
          Somewhere, someone exhales for the last time.<br />
          Somewhere, the machine hums on.<br />
          Somewhere, someone whispers a name,<br />
          a prayer pressed between cracking lips.<br /><br />
          They call for mercy,<br />
          their throat retches as they scream for tomorrow,<br />
          until the lights flicker, the wires disconnect,<br />
          and we realizeâ€”
