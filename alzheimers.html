          A woman stares at a photograph.<br />
          A daughter. A husband. A house she built.<br />
          The walls are warm, the past untouchedâ€”<br />
          until her mind becomes a house fire,<br />
          burning through the names, the faces, the years.<br />
          She is here. She is already gone.<br />
          Tomorrow, her breath will slip into the dark.<br />
          Tomorrow, the ledger will forget her name too.
