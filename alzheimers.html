      <em>
        A woman stares at a photograph.<br />
        A daughter. A husband. A house she built.<br />
        The walls are warm, the past untouchedâ€”<br />
        until her mind becomes a house fire,<br />
        burning through the names, the faces, the years.<br />
        She is here. She is already gone.<br />
        Tomorrow, her breath will slip into the dark.<br />
        Tomorrow, the ledger will forget her name too.
