      <em>
        Tonight, a father grips his chest in the dark.<br />
        The walls press inward, the air thick with echoes.<br />
        His body, a traitor, turns against him—<br />
        his veins choke, his heart stutters, his breath folds.<br />
        Death slithers through his lineage like an inheritance.<br />
        It has waited patiently.<br />
        He has outrun it for years. No longer.<br />
        The ambulance is a siren in the distance,<br />
        a promise that will not be kept.<br />
        His pain splinters through him like fractured glass.<br />
        Tomorrow, he won’t feel a thing.
