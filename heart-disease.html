        <em>
          Tonight, a father grips his chest in the dark.<br />
          The walls press inward, the air thick with echoes.<br />
          His body, a traitor, turns against him—<br />
          his veins choke, his heart stutters, his breath folds.<br />
          Death slithers through his lineage like an inheritance.<br />
          It has waited patiently.<br />
          He has outrun it for years. No longer.<br />
          The ambulance is a siren in the distance,<br />
          a promise that will not be kept.<br />
          His pain splinters through him like fractured glass.<br />
          Tomorrow, he won’t feel a thing.
        </em>
