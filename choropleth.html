      <em>
        
To my mirage of tomorrow, </br>
The numbers are in.</br>
</br>
We clung to the promise of a new millennium,</br>
brushed away the brittle dust of the past,</br>
smiled wide, teeth bared against the unknown,</br>
waved our history goodbye, and our futures—hello.</br>
</br>
Somewhere outside, someone leaves a note.</br>
Somewhere outside, a phone rings into silence.</br>
A soul, somewhere out there, can no longer pretend.</br>
But alas, we’ll focus on tomorrow.</br>
</br>
But what does tomorrow really promise?</br>
Is she softer, sweeter,</br>
Does she glimmer in the early light like fool’s gold?</br>
</br>
Does she hush the mother in the ward,</br>
rocking prayers between trembling fingers,</br>
watching, waiting, whispering spells of survival?</br>
</br>
Does she quiet the humming of the machines,</br>
or does she feed them?</br>
Does she dispense the poison, or does she supply it?</br>
</br>
Tomorrow, the stock price rises.</br>
</br>
But don’t shy away from this horror now.</br>
We’ve only just begun.</br>
