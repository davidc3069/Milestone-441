      <em>
        And on our journey to this dystopian heaven,</br>
does a son get to stay tethered to the machine</br>
that breathes for him?</br>
</br>
Three times a week.</br>
The repetition, the rhythm, the ritual of survival.</br>
Consistency is key. Consistency is life.</br>
</br>
A donor is turned away.</br>
A kidney is lost to the highest bidder.</br>
But the numbers remain steady, fret not.</br>
</br>
Tomorrow, the ledger will not be noticed.</br>
