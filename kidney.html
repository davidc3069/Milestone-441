        <em>
          And on our journey to this dystopian heaven,<br />
          does a son get to stay tethered to the machine<br />
          that breathes for him?<br /><br />
          Three times a week.<br />
          The repetition, the rhythm, the ritual of survival.<br />
          Consistency is key. Consistency is life.<br /><br />
          A donor is turned away.<br />
          A kidney is lost to the highest bidder.<br />
          But the numbers remain steady, fret not.<br /><br />
          Tomorrow, the ledger will not be noticed.
