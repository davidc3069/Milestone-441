          So run—skate across the ice, drive toward love,<br />
          chase the joy you believe is yours to keep.<br /><br />
          But when they call it unintentional,<br />
          what they really mean is unattended.<br /><br />
          Tomorrow, will you ration care?<br />
          Tomorrow, will you still refuse to ration death?<br /><br />
          The waiting rooms will still be full,<br />
          lined with ghosts before they’ve turned to ash.<br />
          A bloodied hand will reach toward you,<br />
          fingers curled in the shape of a plea,<br />
          desperate to hold, to love, to stay.
