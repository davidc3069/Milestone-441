      <em>
        So run—skate across the ice, drive toward love,<br />
        chase the joy you believe is yours to keep.<br /><br />
        But when they call it unintentional,<br />
        what they really mean is unattended.<br /><br />
        Tomorrow, will you ration care?<br />
        Tomorrow, will you still refuse to ration death?<br /><br />
        The waiting rooms will still be full,<br />
        lined with ghosts before they’ve turned to ash.<br />
        A bloodied hand will reach toward you,<br />
        fingers curled in the shape of a plea,<br />
        desperate to hold, to love, to stay.
